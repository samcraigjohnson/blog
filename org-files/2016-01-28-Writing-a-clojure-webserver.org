#+TITLE: Reading/writing from a socket in Clojure
#+DATE: 2016-01-28

I have been wanting to learn Clojure so I decided on the fun journey of writing a web server in Clojure. It seemed like a good way for me to get acquainted with all the fun parts of Clojure (Functional Programming, Immutability, Concurrency) and also learn more about my current field -- web development. For this post I am going to focus on just reading and writing from a socket, which is fun in it self! I got a head start on the basics for this by reading a [[https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/05_network-io/5-10_tcp-server.asciidoc][helpful TCP intro]].

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn slurp-socket []
    "whatever whatever")

#+END_SRC
